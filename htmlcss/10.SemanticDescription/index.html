                        <h3>Exploring the Potential and Ethical Challenges of Brain Implants</h3>
                        <details>
                            <p>Brain implants, also known as neural implants, are devices surgically placed into the brain to restore or enhance neurological functions. These implants can help treat conditions like Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and severe depression by stimulating specific brain regions. Recent advancements in technology have also opened possibilities for brain-computer interfaces, enabling direct communication between the brain and external devices. While promising, the ethical and safety implications of such technologies are subjects of ongoing debate and research.</p>
